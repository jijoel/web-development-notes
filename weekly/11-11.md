==================================
I've been working on some simple instructions to start a kata. Mostly straightforward stuff, and it gets laravel working with codeception and phpunit. It only takes about 15-20 minutes to set up. 

I'm finding a tricky issue, though: When I try to migrate a table, I get an error messate "undefined index: migration". I don't see how anything that I've done could have caused that....

I pulled database.php into the app/config/local folder, but when I did that, some critical pieces disappeared.

==================================
Using markdown is simple. In composer.json:

    "require": {
        "vtalbot/markdown": "1.4.*@dev",

In the providers array of app/config/app.php:

    'VTalbot\Markdown\MarkdownServiceProvider',

In our presenter:

```php
    use VTalbot\Markdown\Facades\Markdown;
    use Robbo\Presenter\Presenter;

    class MyPresenter extends Presenter
    {
        public function presentDesc()
        {
            return Markdown::string($this->desc);
        }
    }
```

We also have to create a markdown directory in storage:

    mkdir app/storage/markdown


I think the little app I'm working on now is getting close. Next steps:

 * Create reservation records
 * Cancel reservation records
 * Admin interface
