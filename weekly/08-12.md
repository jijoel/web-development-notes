======================================

Installing npm, bower, and yeoman on my home computer...

    download nodejs from http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.15/node-v0.10.15.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf node-v0.10.15.tar.gz
    sudo apt-get install g++
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower

It seems to work, but I'm not sure of what all it does, yet.

I wonder what it would take to start running php 5.5 on my computer...

###Testing
Running a plain test, directly from the Way generator, I'm getting an error with testing a controller. The error is:

> Fatal error: Call to a member function __call() on a non-object in C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\vendor\mockery\mockery\library\Mockery\Generator.php(129) : eval()'d code on line 1268

Some of the error chain looks like this:

> PHP  13. CategoriesTest->testStore() C:\wamp\bin\tools\vendor\phpunit\phpunit\PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase.php:976
> PHP  14. Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase->call() C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\app\tests\controllers\CategoriesTest.php:50
> PHP  28. CategoriesController->store() C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\vendor\laravel\framework\src\Illuminate\Routing\Controllers\Controller.php:138
> PHP  29. Mockery_871093988::create() C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\app\controllers\CategoriesController.php:60

Let's comment out everything except the Index method...

Still getting errors... 

> InvalidArgumentException: View [layouts.scaffold] not found.

I can copy that over...

> Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\RouteNotFoundException: Unable to generate a URL for the named route "home" as such route does not exist.

Right. I can copy over all of the framework/basic views...

> Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\RouteNotFoundException: Unable to generate a URL for the named route "signin" as such route does not exist.

... and I can copy the AuthController, and all of the auth routes...

> 1) CatTest::testShouldReturnCatYears
> Failed asserting that 6 matches expected 42.

Doh!

If I don't use CategoriesTest, the CatYears test works...

And if I reduce CategoriesTest to a very simple case, CatYears works...

```php
    class CategoriesTest extends TestCase {
        public function testWorks { $this->assertTrue(True); }
    }
```

CatYears fails when I add this line to the __construct function in CategoriesTest:

    $this->mock = m::mock('Eloquent', 'Category');

It succeeds if I do this, though:

    $this->mock = m::mock('BaseModel', 'Category');

(Note that BaseModel extends from the full name of the model, not the alias)
This also works:

    $this->mock = m::mock('Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model', 'Category');

Ahhhh.... have I found my tiny test set?


### Please Help: Message to Laravel board...

From a fresh install of Laravel, I install a copy of mockery. I add the following to composer.json, then run composer update:

    "require-dev": {
        "mockery/mockery": "dev-master"
    },

Next, I create a test and a model, based on the "Cat Years" example on page 90 of <a href="https://leanpub.com/laravel-testing-decoded">Laravel Testing Decoded</a>:

app/tests/CatTest.php:

``` php
    class CatTest extends TestCase
    {
        public function testShouldReturnCatYears()
        {
            $cat = new Cat;
            $cat->age = 6;
            $this->assertEquals(42, $cat->age);
        }
    }
```

app/models/Cat.php:

``` php
    class Cat extends Eloquent 
    {
        public function setAgeAttribute($age) 
        {
            $this->age = $age * 7;
        }
    }
```

At this point, I can run phpunit, and everything passes. I have 2 tests, they both pass. Now, I add another test (based on standard output from Jeffrey Way's <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators">Laravel Generators</a>):

app/tests/FooControllerTest.php:

``` php
    Class FooControllerTest extends TestCase
    {
        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->mock = \Mockery::mock('Eloquent', 'Foo');
        }

        // I include this to avoid the standard 'No tests found' warning:
        public function testWorks()  { $this->assertTrue(True); }
    }
```

When I run phpunit at this point, it fails, giving me an error:

1) CatTest::testShouldReturnCatYears
Failed asserting that 6 matches expected 42.

It works if I change the constructor line to either of these:

    $this->mock = \Mockery::mock('Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model', 'Foo');
    $this->mock = \Mockery::mock('SomeClassThatDoesNotExist');

So, apparently, the test environment isn't happy about the 'Eloquent' alias in particular. Has anyone else seen this? Any idea what causes it? Is there a way around it? 

Thank you!



### More information

I'm continuing some setup...

Adding this to routes.php:

```php
Route::resource('foo', 'FooController');
```

Creating app/views/foo.blade.php:

```php
foo.blade.php opened
```

Creating app/controllers/FooController.php:

```php
    class FooController extends BaseController
    {
        protected $foo;

        public function __construct(Foo $foo)
        {
            $this->foo = $foo;
        }

        public function index()
        {
            $foo = $this->foo->all();
            return View::make('foo', compact('foo'));
        }
    }
```

Updating app/tests/FooControllertest.php:

```php
    Class FooControllerTest extends TestCase
    {
        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->mock = \Mockery::mock('Eloquent', 'Foo');
            $this->collection = \Mockery::mock('Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection')->shouldDeferMissing();
        }

        public function setUp()
        {
            parent::setUp();
            $this->app->instance('Foo', $this->mock);
        }

        public function tearDown()
        {
            \Mockery::close();
        }

        public function testIndex()
        {
            $this->mock->shouldReceive('all')->once()->andReturn($this->collection);

            $this->call('GET', 'foo');

            $this->assertViewHas('foo');
        }

        public function testWorks()  { $this->assertTrue(True); }
    }
```

It still fails with all of that.

When I move the definition of the mock object into a function, though, it starts working again.

```php
    public function testIndex()
    {
        $this->mock = \Mockery::mock('Eloquent', 'Foo');
        ...
```

It also works if I just mock 'Foo' (but not Eloquent) in the constructor:

```php
    $this->mock = \Mockery::mock('Foo');
```

I've tried this with several of the standard tests, now, and it seems to work for all of them.

Bottom line: If you're getting strange values from accessors and mutators, make sure you're not trying to mock Eloquent in the constructor...


Creating a Class
-------------------
But then, what happens when we create a Foo class, extended from Eloquent? I'm getting errors all over the place again.

If I use `class Foo extends Eloquent`, it gives me this error:

> PHP Fatal error:  Class 'Eloquent' not found in C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\app\models\Foo.php on line 4

If I use `class Foo extends Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`, it gives me this:

> 1) FooControllerTest::testIndex
> BadMethodCallException: Method Foo::setAttribute() does not exist on this mock object

Basically, it's failing when trying to set rules. What if I just don't set the attribute? Comment that out...

> PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function __call() on a non-object in C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\vendor\mockery\mockery\library\Mockery\Generator.php(129) : eval()'d code on line 1260

Comment out everything; methods with problems are:

> public function testStore()
> BadMethodCallException: Method Foo::getAttribute() does not exist on this mock object
> (FooControllerTest:44; FooController:26;  looking for $this->foo->rules)

I can fix this by modifying the constructor, changing this:

    $this->mock = \Mockery::mock('Foo');

To this:

    $this->mock = \Mockery::mock('Foo')->shouldDeferMissing();

Next, we get this error:

> PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function __call() on a non-object in C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\vendor\mockery\mockery\library\Mockery\Generator.php(129) : eval()'d code on line 1260
>
> PHP  29. Mockery_202193662::create() C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\app\controllers\FooController.php:31

It's failing on this:

    $this->foo->create($input);

My mock object should be receiving a 'create' method... 

so, is it not hitting the mock object???



Tuesday, 13 August 2013 
======================================

I'm really not sure why the tests aren't working. What if we were to go back to a fresh install, run the Way generator, and then create a Cat object? What would happen?

Using git, I'm not sure how to revert to a spot, then create a new branch from it...

I think I've managed to wipe out my original code. :-(

Actually, no. I have these:

* 5d632ba (HEAD, origin/master, master) files to test
* 5194b7e initial commit

To switch back to the initial commit, as it was before I did anything:

    git reset 5194b7e               // moves back to the initial commit
    git checkout -- .               // unstages changes to initial commit (modified files)
    git clean -f                    // removes new files (created in commit:files to test)

To switch, again, to the 'files to test' commit, with everything it has:

    git reset 5d632ba
    git checkout -- .

So, starting from a fresh install of Laravel,

Add this to composer.json:

``` json
    "require-dev": {
        "mockery/mockery": "dev-master",
        "way/generators": "dev-master"
    },
```

Add way generators to providers array:

    'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider' 

Create a test database config at app/config/testing/database.php:

```php
    return array( 
        'default' => 'sqlite',
        'connections' => array(
            'sqlite' => array(
                'driver'   => 'sqlite',
                'database' => ':memory:',
                'prefix'   => ''
            ),
        )
    );
```

Generate a scaffold:

    php artisan generate:scaffold foo --fields='name:string'

Modify a couple of things in  tests/controllers/FoosTest.php 

array declarations: change `([name...` to `array(name...`  to work with php 5.3
setUp function:     $this->attributes = Factory::foo(array('id' => 1, 'name'=>'foo'));

Tests are green. Now, add the Cat model.

app/tests/CatTest.php:

``` php
    class CatTest extends TestCase
    {
        public function testShouldReturnCatYears()
        {
            $cat = new Cat;
            $cat->age = 6;
            $this->assertEquals(42, $cat->age);
        }
    }
```

app/models/Cat.php:

``` php
    class Cat extends Eloquent 
    {
        public function setAgeAttribute($age) 
        {
            $this->age = $age * 7;
        }
    }
```

... and we're red. It's not returning the correct number for cat years.

Comment out everything for FoosTest, we're back to green.

When I try to remove 'Eloquent' from the constructor, I get this error: 

> PHP Fatal error:  Class 'Eloquent' not found in C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\app\models\Foo.php on line 3

If I change Foo.php to extend from `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` instead of `Eloquent`, it goes back to green.

What if my FoosTest, with Eloquent, somehow overrides Eloquent?

The tests for CatYears fail, even if I run them first...

Hmmmm..... 

I think this is happening globally... I think it's returning the same object any time Eloquent is requested.

When everything but the FoosTest constructor is commented out, and we mock with m::mock('Foo'):

    Mock With       Foo Extends         Cat Extends         Result
    'Foo'           Eloquent            Eloquent            Class 'Eloquent' not found
    'Foo'           Illuminate...       Eloquent            green
    'Eloquent',     Eloquent            Eloquent            red (cat fails)
    'Eloquent',     Eloquent            Illuminate...       green
    'Eloquent',     Illuminate...       Illuminate...       green

Foo can extend either, because the definition of Eloquent is changed for Foo. 

I'm wondering about the Facade...

    Facade::resolveFacadeInstance is called multiple times for each test
    Facade::clearResolvedInstance is called once (by ExampleTest::testBasicExample)
    Facade::clearResolvedInstances seems to be called once for each test
    Facade::getFacadeApplication is called multiple times for each test
    Facade::setFacadeApplication seems to be called once for each test
    Facade::__callStatic is called multiple times for each test

Testing for CatYears, then True (in FooTest), then CatYears again (showing the name of the facade instance being requested, and both Cat and Foo extending from Elequent) gives us this:

    Fstring(3) "log"        // Fail: CatYears
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    .string(3) "log"        // OK: FooTest::testTrue
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(3) "app"
    Fstring(3) "log"        // Fail:: CatYears
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(3) "app"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"
    string(6) "router"

It's never looking for Eloquent, but Eloquent isn't a facade.


### HTML Canvas

At home, I'm playing a little bit with HTML canvas. I want to be able to draw blocks with text, clipped to a given location. Here's a start on that:

``` js
    var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
    var context = canvas.getContext('2d');

    function writeTextBlock(left, top, width, height, text) 
    {
        context.save();                 // Saves the visible region, so we can un-clip, later
        context.beginPath();
        context.rect(left, top, width, height);
        context.clip();                 // Output can only take place in the given viewport
        
        context.beginPath();
        context.rect(left, top, width, height);
        context.fillStyle = "yellow";
        context.fill();
        context.lineWidth = 2;
        context.strokeStyle = 'black';
        context.stroke();
        
        context.fillStyle = 'black';
        context.font = '18pt Calibri';
        context.fillText(text, left+4, top+20);
        context.restore();              // Restore to standard (saved) viewport
    }

    writeTextBlock(1,1,100,50, 'This is a test');
    writeTextBlock(1,50,130,20, 'Something else');

    context.beginPath();
    context.rect(120, 50, 200, 100);
    context.clip();

    context.beginPath();
    context.rect(120, 50, 200, 100);
    context.fillStyle = 'yellow';
    context.fill();
    context.lineWidth = 7;
    context.strokeStyle = 'black';
    context.stroke();

    context.fillStyle = 'blue';
    context.font = 'italic 40pt Calibri';
    context.fillText('Hello World!', 150, 100);
```

Here's an example, using KineticJS:

```js
    var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({
        container: 'container',
        width: 578,
        height: 300
    });

    var layer = new Kinetic.Layer();

    var group = new Kinetic.Group({
        clip: [100, 40, 200, 100],
        draggable: true
    });

    var yellowCircle = new Kinetic.Circle({
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        radius: 50,
        fill: 'yellow',
        stroke: 'black',
        draggable: true,
    });

    var blueBlob = new Kinetic.Blob({
        points: [73, 140, 340, 23, 500, 109, 300, 170],
        stroke: 'blue',
        strokeWidth: 10,
        fill: '#aaf',
        tension: 0.8,
    });

    var redBlob = new Kinetic.Blob({
        points: [73, 140, 340, 23, 500, 109],
        stroke: 'red',
        strokeWidth: 10,
        fill: '#faa',
        tension: 1.2,
        scale: 0.5,
        x: 100,
        y: 50,
        draggable: true,
    });

    var someText = new Kinetic.Text({
        x: 105,
        y: 45,
        text: 'Some Text',
        fill: 'black',
        fontSize: 20,
        fontFamily: 'Calibri',
        draggable: true,
    });

    layer.add(yellowCircle);
    group.add(blueBlob);
    group.add(redBlob);
    group.add(someText);
    layer.add(group);
    stage.add(layer);
```
