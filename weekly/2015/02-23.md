======================
I'm not sure how best to structure something. Basically, I would like to modify my DateRange class so that it's not dependent on Laravel at all, in any way. Ideally, I'd also like to split out the formatting to a FormattedCarbon object (or some such thing).

My question is how to tell the FormattedCarbon object what formats are available. I want to read the format data from a configuration file. Ideally, I'd like that to be compatible with Laravel's configuration files, so that I can modify it as I see fit, later. So, how can I do that?

If the DateRange class creates FormattedCarbon objects directly, it won't be creating descendents of them... how can we tell them how to get format data?

Is the best way to use Laravel-style make() functions?

	$foo = (new DateRange())->make($start, $end);	// better?
	$foo = new DateRange($start, $end);				// any way to do this?

We could use Laravel's convention for config files, eg "date-range::value.subvalue.etc", and maybe a default way to read that, if Laravel is not in use?

I'm playing a little bit with tags and continuous integration today. It's fun, and I can include shields on my github pages.

Shields can be generated from shields.io.

	http://img.shields.io

There is a big list of available options; I want to use Scrutinizer (code quality) and Travis (continuous integration). Travis needs a .travis.yml file:

	language: php
	php:
	  - 5.4
	  - 5.5
	  - 5.6
	  - hhvm
	  - nightly

	before_script:
	  - composer install --dev

Once set up, I should be able to include the shields like this:

<a href="mailto://joel@kumuwai.com"><img src="http://img.shields.io/badge/author-joel@kumuwai.com-blue.svg" alt="Author"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/kumuwai/date-range"><img src="http://img.shields.io/badge/source-kumuwai%2Fdate--range-blue.svg" alt="Source Code"></a>
<a href="LICENSE.md"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg" alt="Software License"></a>
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kumuwai/date-range"><img src="https://img.shields.io/travis/kumuwai/date-range/master.svg" alt="Build Status"></a>
<a href="https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/kumuwai/date-range"><img src="https://img.shields.io/scrutinizer/g/kumuwai/date-range.svg" alt="Quality Score"></a>

Fun... I see that my date range class is failing. It looks like it mostly has to do with timezone issues. That's nice to be aware of early so that I can fix it...
