===========================
I recently got asked the question if we can automatically email a copy of receipts to customers. Hmmmm.... If we could turn it into a pdf, we could... (we could just get the data to them anyway, but need a pdf for formatting).

I tried using barryvdh/laravel-dompdf, but discovered that it doesn't handle svg graphics at all. It just drops them. Plus, the formatting was horrific. Can barryvdh/laravel-snappy handle them, and do better formatting? Maybe...

	sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf

    $html = $View::make('guests.receipt',compact('guest'))->render();
    $pdf = PDF::loadHTML($html)->stream();
	dd($pdf);

This returns almost instantaly, and shows me empty content. It didn't render. Let's try to save, instead:

    PDF::loadHTML($html)->save(storage_path().'/transfer/test.pdf');

I did at least get an error message, that time:

	The exit status code '1' says something went wrong: stderr: "wkhtmltopdf: cannot connect to X server " stdout: "" command: /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf --lowquality --page-size 'letter' '/tmp/knp_snappy54ee29622c80f2.60710828.html' '.../storage/transfer/test.pdf'.

Run headless on a virtual x server:

	sudo apt-get install xvfb

It seems to be working, but now failing due to an http error.

	Exit with code 1 due to http error: 1203

Hmmm... It works, and it looks good, but it still doesn't have the svg. If I remove the svg, it doesn't exit with an error code.

    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/img/logos/KLogoTopLeftGB.svg" width="200px" style="position: relative; left: -40px"></object>

What if we use a simple svg?

    <img src="/img/logos/KLogoTopLeftGB.svg" width="200px" style="position: relative; left: -40px">

Hmmm... Now, it includes an empty image box (like it's not found). How can I see what it's looking for?  It doesn't pick up a .png file, either...

Hmmm... it looks like it requires absolute paths to all files (from root of the filesystem, not the web root). I see this is a faq: https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/issues/104

	This is not the php problem, you need to put full image path because wkhtmltopdf lib run from the system it self and doesn't now about web root path provided by the http server.

	To have host url you can use php default variable HTTP_HOST

So, we need absolute paths for everything we want to use an image of...

	<img src="http://kdb.dev/img/masthead/kitchen.jpg">   // works -- for dev
	<img src="/img/masthead/kitchen.jpg">                 // does not work

And we need a mechanism to rewrite them, on the fly, based on the host.

    $site_url = "{$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME']}://{$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']}";
    $html = preg_replace('/(<img.*?src=")(.*">)/',"$1$site_url$2",$html);

So, before trying to run pdf, I use:

    $site_url = "{$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME']}://{$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']}";
    $html = preg_replace('/(<img.*?src=")(?!http)(.*">)/',"$1$site_url/$2",$html);
    PDF::loadHTML($html)
        ->save(storage_path().'/transfer/test.pdf');

That works very well.

The one remaining problem is things that run to two or more pages. It's currently printing a footer on the bottom of the page; if they run multiple pages, it should put the footer at the bottom of the last. Or just on the last...

I can use Javascript to calculate the document height, and if it's over a given height, I can change the css. The challenge is in doing that for both the html / print and wkhtmltopdf / generate pdf. The sizes of the components are different in each:

                           chrome  wkhtmltopdf
single page pixels:         917 vs 2793
single (full) page pixels: 1101 vs 3301
two page pixels:           1759 vs 4427
long doc pixels:           6107 vs 15055

The documents end up being roughly the same size. wkhtmltopdf is a little smaller, actually. So, what makes the difference? Is there a way that I can tell if it's running via wkhtmltopdf?

Hmmm... it's not wide enough... 637px instead of 1651.  Because I used the example when setting up wkhtmltopdf...

	xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 640x480x16" /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf "$@"

What if we make that screen bigger?

	xvfb-run -n 9 -s "-screen 9 1920x1080x16" /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf "$@"

... it doesn't seem to make a difference...

how about width * height?

single page pixels:         1651 x 917 = 1513967   vs 605 x 2793 = 1689765
single (full) page pixels:  1651 x 1101 = 1817751  vs 637 x 3031 = 1930747
two page pixels:            1651 x 1759 = 2904109  vs 662 x 4427 = 2930674
long doc pixels:           6107 vs 15055

I think it's good, now. The resulting script looks like this:

```js
    <script type="text/javascript">
        size = 0;
        $(function(){
            size = $(document).height() * $(document).width();
        });

        var media = window.matchMedia('print');

        media.addListener(function(data) {
            $('#footer').removeClass('bottom');
            if(size < 2000000 && (data.matches)) {
                $('#footer').addClass('bottom');
            }
        });
    </script>
```

The mail method is currently pretty ugly, but it does work:

```php
    public function getHtml($guestId)
    {
        $html = $this->getRenderedHtmlWithAbsolutePaths($guestId);
        return $html;
    }

    public function getPdf($guestId)
    {
        $html = $this->getRenderedHtmlWithAbsolutePaths($guestId);
        return PDF::loadHTML($html)->stream();
    }

    public function getMail($guestId)
    {
        $guest = $this->visit->findOrFail($guestId);
        if ( ! $guest->email )
            return $this->fail($guestId, Lang::get('kdb.guests.no-email'));

        // TODO: See if this guest has already received a receipt;
        // ask for verification, if they have

        $html = $this->getRenderedHtmlWithAbsolutePaths($guestId);

        try {
            $filespec = storage_path()."/transfer/{$guest->name} Receipt.pdf";
            $pdf = PDF::loadHTML($html)->save($filespec);

            Mail::send('emails.guests.receipt', array(), 
                function($message) use($guest, $filespec){
                    $message->to($guest->email)
                        ->subject('Receipt for your stay at Kalani')
                        ->from('kalani@kalani.com', 'Kalani')
                        ->attach($filespec, [
                            'as'=>'Receipt', 
                            'mime'=>'application/pdf'
                        ]);
            });
            File::delete($filespec);

        } catch (Exception $e) {
            return $this->fail($guestId, $e->getMessage());
        }

        Session::flash('success',Lang::get('kdb.guests.receipt-sent'));
        return $this->loadDetailContent($guestId, False);
    }

    private function loadDetailContent($guestId, $showMail)
    {
        $guest = $this->visit->find($guestId);
        $summary = [
            'lodging'=>True, 
            'show-balance' => False,
            'show-mail' => $showMail,
        ];

        if (! $guest)
            return '';

        if ($guest->cancelled_at)
            $summary['lodging'] = False;

        return View::make('guests.receipt.receipt')
            ->with(compact('guest','summary'));
    }

    private function fail($guestId, $message)
    {
        Session::flash('error', $message);
        return $this->loadDetailContent($guestId, False);
    }

    private function getRenderedHtmlWithAbsolutePaths($guestId)
    {
        $html = $this->loadDetailContent($guestId, False)->render();
        $site_url = "{$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME']}://{$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']}";
        return preg_replace('/(<img.*?src=")(?!http)(.*">)/',"$1$site_url/$2",$html);
    }
```

I'm not really sure how to make that pretty, either...
