====================
I'm running in to an issue with a complex join. Basically, I have:

    Charge:  id 
    Refund:  id, charge_id
    Transfer: id
    Transfer_Charges: id, transfer_id, charge_id

I would like to connect Transfer to Charge and Refund. Charge is fine:

    public function transfers()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(
            self::MY_NAMESPACE . 'Transfer',
            'transfer_charges',
            'charge_id',
            'transfer_id'
        );
    }

Now, I'd like to get refunds. If I use the above query, I run into the problem that it's searching for the refund id, not the charge id in the refund table.

    return $this->charge->transfers();

This doesn't appear to be giving me correct results... Not sure why....

My problem was that I was using a with statement:

    ->with('transfers')

It should have been:

    ->with('charge.transfers')

And now everything seems to be working...
