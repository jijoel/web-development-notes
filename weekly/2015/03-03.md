=====================
It's time to play with Laravel 5 for a bit. I'd also like to play with building a component, and with testing from outside in.

I've been working with Stripe for a little bit, and think it would be fun to write a Stripe campaign reporter. Several outside services (causes.com, etc.) integrate with Stripe. It would be interesting to write a mini app that will load data from Stripe and report on it.

Can we include a method to locally test for Stripe data? (eg, don't download anything from stripe, but from a given local datasource?) 

Stripe sends JSON data. Can I write something to:

    1. Generate test data
    2. Submit it to the stripe server 
    3. Send a request for data to the stripe server
    4. Download the response as json
    5. Run a test server which delivers the json data

That should get me a gold master that I can start using for tests. 

Even just that is a bit of a project...

We can run a test server with:

    php -S localhost:8000 example_test_file.php

The script can be ridiculously simple:

```php
    // router.php
    if (preg_match('/\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/', $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"])) {
        return false;    // serve the requested resource as-is.
    } else { 
        echo "<p>Welcome to PHP</p>";   // or my own things here...
    }
```

I wonder how that will work with things like travis.ci?

I read about some additional options for .travis.yml:

    language: php

    # list any PHP version you want to test against
    php:
      # using major version aliases

      # aliased to 5.2.17
      - 5.2
      # aliased to 5.3.29
      - 5.3
      # aliased to a recent 5.4.x version
      - 5.4
      # aliased to a recent 5.5.x version
      - 5.5
      # aliased to a recent 5.6.x version
      - 5.6

    # optionally specify a list of environments, for example to test different RDBMS
    env:
      - DB=mysql
      - DB=pgsql

    services:
      - mysql

    # execute any number of scripts before the test run, custom env's are available as variables
    before_script:
      - if [[ "$DB" == "pgsql" ]]; then psql -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS hello_world_test;" -U postgres; fi
      - mysql -e 'create database foo_test;'
      - mv application/config/database.travis application/config/database.php
      - php -S localhost:8000 httpdocs/index.php &
      - sleep 3

    # omitting "script:" will default to phpunit
    # use the $DB env variable to determine the phpunit.xml to use
    script: phpunit --configuration phpunit_$DB.xml --coverage-text
      - ./bin/behat --config application/tests/behat.yml  # run behat
      - phpunit -c application/tests/phpunit.xml          # run php unit

    # configure notifications (email, IRC, campfire etc)
    notifications:
      irc: "irc.freenode.org#yourfavouriteroomfortravis"

Running the php webserver would only work for php >= 5.4.0; but that is also what Laravel requires. 

How can I generate test data?

I can use faker; that's easy enough... but how can I get credit card tokens from Stripe?

======================
I've been playing with CI tools, and think I've come up with a nice workflow using them. Basically, we want to be fully tested and ready to go before pushing, and particularly before merging with a branch (particularly main)... To do this, I can create a release branch, push that up, and file a pull request. The CI tools will then tell me if it's safe to merge. Once tested (on a global system), I can merge the branch, and delete it elsewhere.

    git checkout -b release/v0.0.2
    git add .
    git commit   (write a message in the commit)
    git push origin release/v0.0.2:release/v0.0.2

On github, submit a pull request. The CI tools will automatically work. Once done, I can remove the remote branch. Locally:

    git branch -d release/v0.0.2
    git branch -d -r origin/release/v0.0.2

Hmmm.... Weird thing happening with keys...

```php
    public function testNormal()
    {
        $test = [['name'=>'foo'],['name'=>'bar'],['name'=>'fizz'],['name'=>'buzz'],];

        foreach($test as $key=>$item)
            echo $key;                     // gives me 0123 (correct)

        foreach ($test as $item)
            echo key($item);               // gives me namenamenamename (????)
    }
```

Ahhh... they shouldn't be used like that. Just as $key=>$item...

I've just read about something with Composer. You can update a single package at a time:

    composer update foo/bar --prefer-dist    // ignores files marked with --export-ignore in .gitattributes
    composer update foo/bar --prefer-source  // include everything (useful for pushing changes)

In laravel/framework, for example, .gitattributes has:

    /build export-ignore
    /tests export-ignore

`composer update laravel/framework --prefer-source`  seems to have done something interesting, though. It's downloading the source for all of the packages called by Laravel. Hmmm.... There don't seem to be any source files...

There are source files for league/csv and league/fractal, though. Alltogether, those directories are 4.4MB (including source). 

    update league/fractal league/csv --prefer-source   // 4.4 MB; includes git history, tests, etc.
    update league/fractal league/csv --prefer-dist     // 244 KB; no history, no tests

These are recommended:

    /.gitattributes     export-ignore
    /.gitignore         export-ignore
    /.travis.yml        export-ignore
    /docs               export-ignore
    /phpunit.xml        export-ignore
    /tests              export-ignore

One more thing: I'm not sure why pushing a branch up to github, and then attempting to merge it, is firing off two build requests; maybe a third when I actually merge it. How can I work so that it would only fire one? (is it safe to merge?)

Also interesting: Scrutinizer loved me pulling out some of the methods of the Iterator. My code quality went from 8.85 to 9.87. Hmmmm.... I've been wondering if it would be better as a trait. It seems pretty solidly generic...

Oh, wow! Pretty! League\Csv can turn any random csv file into an associated array:

    $csv = \League\Csv\Reader::createFromPath($filename); 
    $csv->fetchAssoc();

Creating a csv file isn't much harder:

    $found = $this->model->all();
    $csv = Writer::createFromFileObject(new SplTempFileObject());
    $csv->insertOne(["header","fields","here"]);
    $csv->insertAll($found);     // all fields

    foreach($found as $item) {   // only some fields
        $csv->insertOne([
            $item->field,
            ...
        ]);
    }

    return $csv->output("filename.csv");

Hmmmm... I think I've just figured out how to serve up images and data from a local page (no framework, only composer as a dependency). At the beginning of the file, enter this:

    <?php
    if (preg_match('/\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico)$/', $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"])) {
        return false;
    }

    include_once(__DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php');

    $driver = new Path\To\My\Driver;

    if (isset($_REQUEST))
        $driver->postFormData($_REQUEST);
    
    $data = $driver->getFormData();
    ?>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    ...

The php driver class needs two methods:

    public function postFormData($data) {}
    public function getFormData() {}

You can specify config settings in a local php.ini file, eg:

    upload_max_filesize = 6M

Use this to serve the files:

    php -S localhost:8080 -c php.ini public/index.php

Fascinating... someone on a forum brought up a question about Intervention/Image; it was running out of memory. I ran into the same issue last year. Basically, the gd driver failed (silently) when the image was too big.

I tried writing a very quick and dirty app to test this. Basically, just this:

```php
    use Intervention\Image\ImageManager;

    class Skeleton
    {

        public function postFormData()
        {
            if (! isset($_FILES['foo']))
                return;

            $file = $_FILES['foo'];
            $uploaded = $file["tmp_name"];
            $name = $file['name'];

            try {
                $manager = new ImageManager(['driver'=>'gd']);
                $image = $manager->make($uploaded)->fit(300,200)->save(__DIR__.'/../public/image.jpg');            
            } catch (\Exception $e) {
                var_dump($file);
            }
        }
    }
```

```html
    < ?php
    if (preg_match('/\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico)$/', $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]))
        return false;

    include_once(__DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php');
    $master = new Skeleton;
    $master->postFormData($_REQUEST);
    ?>

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Upload an image</p>
        
        <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
            Image: <input type="file" name="foo">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>

        <p>previously uploaded image</p>
        <img src="/public/image.jpg">
    </body>
    </html>
```

Pretty simple; in php.ini, I set `upload_max_filesize = 12M` and `memory_limit = 2M`. And that's working... but it's not failing on me, any more. Yay! Not sure what magic it is that makes this happen, though...

Doh! How is it that I haven't noticed just how nice github's wikis are until now?

I've just added a bunch of stuff to a project wiki. Nice.

Trying to create a new package. I want it to use Eloquent, and Migrations, but not be a Laravel project. It will be a component to (later) load into a Laravel project (but into others, as well). How can I do this?

Maybe start from Laravel, and run workbench?

Playing a little bit with Javascript. I'm trying to get a button to work in medium-editor.

I can create a spacer (pretty simple):

    function MediumSpacer(options) {
        this.options = options;
    }

    MediumSpacer.prototype.getButton = function(instance) {
        return '<button style="min-width:5px;width:5px;cursor:default;"></button>';
    };

I'm having trouble getting a button to apply a style, though. This will make it show up correctly in the button bar:

    var medium = new MediumEditor(article, {
        buttons: ['bold', ... ,'red'],
        extensions: { 'red': new MediumStyleButton('R', 'color:red') }
    }

    function MediumStyleButton(options) {
        this.options = options;
    };

    MediumStyleButton.prototype.getButton = function(instance) {
        return '<button><span style="' + this.options.format + '">' + this.options.label + '</span></button>';
    };

It doesn't actually do anything when clicked. According to the documentation, I should inherit from a DefaultButton class. (MediumEditor.statics.DefaultButton). How do I do that?

Documentation at https://github.com/daviferreira/medium-editor/wiki/Custom-Buttons-and-Extensions

Trying to ge it to do anything, maybe just copy the strikethrough style?

    function MediumStyleButton(label, style) {
        this.parent = true;
        this.options = {
            label: label,
            format: style,
            name: 'strikethrough',
            action: 'strikethrough',
            aria: 'strike through',
            tagNames: ['strike'],
            style: {
                prop: 'text-decoration',
                value: 'line-through'
            },
            useQueryState: true,
            contentDefault: '<s>A</s>',
            contentFA: '<i class="fa fa-strikethrough"></i>'
        };
    };

I tried copying the entire DefaultButton prototype, and applying it directly to MediumStyleButton. No dice. I really just don't know how this stuff works. :-(

I've asked a question on StackOverflow. Maybe someone will know the answer. Maybe not. I'll keep fingers crossed.
