========================
I've been doing some more thinking about how to test models. It seems to me that having a base structure, with all tables available, in their final forms, before running any tests would be beneficial. Maybe there's a way to run all migrations before the entire test suite is run?

I like seeding data for individual tests as part of the test. This test relies on that data. That could also let me set up a separate layer of tests; maybe functional tests / integration tests? ... they'd let me see the full system working together, with some given scenarios (which I can set up in the moment).

I think this would only work if I can use transactions... Create all of the tables / run all of the migrations during the bootstrap process. Use a transaction to seed the test data. Do searches and run processes based on that test data; roll back the transaction at the end of the test.

How do database transactions work? Can I start a transaction, search for things in that transaction, then cancel the transaction? Are transactions nestable? It looks like both of those work. Yay!

I can include that as part of my model testcase.

I can also include a separate bootstrap to run the migrations before running tests. This is modified from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17373557/laravel-create-database-when-testing. The concept is to use the in-memory database.


```php
    /**
     * Bootstrap file for running migrations before running tests
     *
     * You only need to put this file in "bootstrap" directory of the project
     * and change "bootstrap" phpunit parameter within "phpunit.xml"
     * from "bootstrap/autoload.php" to "bootstap/testing.php"
     */

    $testEnvironment = 'testing';

  // // run migrations for packages (maybe)
  // foreach(glob('vendor/*/*', GLOB_ONLYDIR) as $package) {
  //     $packageName = substr($package, 7); // drop "vendor" prefix
  //     passthru("./artisan migrate --package={$packageName} --env={$testEnvironment}");
  // }

    passthru('./artisan migrate --env='.$testEnvironment);

    require('autoload.php'); // run laravel's original bootstap file
```

Hmmm.... another challenge has to do with how to run the migrations. I currently have 74 legacy tables, some with as many as 60 columns. I really don't want to convert all of that to Laravel migrations. But that might be the easiest way to go...

I really do like the idea of doing unit tests for pretty much everything, but I find that I need an outer layer to catch things that unit tests aren't currently catching.

========================
After all this time, I really don't understand mocks. All that I want is something that can stand in place of another object, and return anything that it might return. That's it. I don't want it to go to the original object for anything, in any way. 

Ideally, I'd be able to do something like this:

    $mock = Mockery::mock('MyModel');
    $mock->shouldReceive('find')->with('foo_1')->andReturn($mock);
    $mock->id = 'foo_1';
    $mock->name = 'name';

I don't care that MyModel descends from Eloquent. I don't care what attributes it actually has. 

Interesting... I find I can actually do that, using Mockery::mock('alias:MyModel'). I wonder how that will work when actually using MyModel for something, later...

So far, so good... This might actually work...

Trying to do a remote connection... How can I create and use intermediate objects?

```php
    class Staff
    // legacy table...
    {
        public function getStripeCustomerAttribute()
        {
            if ($this->cardConnection)
                return $this->cardConnection->customer;
        }
        public function getCardsAttribute()
        {
            if ($this->cardConnection && $this->cardConnection->customer)
                return $this->cardConnection->customer->cards->lists('last4');

            return new DTO;
        }
        public function cardConnection()
        {
            return $this->hasOne('StripeConnection');
        }
    }

    class StripeConnection
    // Connect Stripe data to legacy data
    // id, staff_id, other_ids, stripe_customer_id
    {
        public function staff()
        {
            return $this->belongsTo('Staff', 'staff_id');
        }
        public function customer()
        {
            return $this->belongsTo('StripeCustomer', 'stripe_customer');
        }
    }

    class StripeCustomer
    {
        public function cards()
        {
            return $this->hasMany('StripeCard', 'customer_id');
        }
        public function charges()
        {
            return $this->hasMany('StripeCharge', 'card_id');
        }
    }

    class StripeCard
    {
        public function customer()
        {
            return $this->belongsTo('StripeCustomer', 'customer_id');
        }
        public function charges()
        {
            return $this->hasMany('StripeCharge', 'card_id');
        }
    }

    class StripeCharge
    {
        public function customer()
        {
            return $this->belongsTo('StripeCustomer', 'customer_id');
        }
        public function card()
        {
            return $this->belongsTo('StripeCard', 'card_id');
        }
    }
```

From my Staff record, I want to be able to attach a new StripeCustomer. This does not work:

```php
    $staff = Staff::find(1);
    $cust = StripeCustomer::find('cust_1');
    $staff->cardConnection->save($cust);
```

... because stripe_customers does not contain a staff_id field (of course). I don't have a m/m pivot table; more a 1-1 relationship (adapter table). How do I save the pivot?

```php
    $conn = new StripeConnection;
    $conn->staff_id = $staff->id;
    $conn->stripe_customer = $stripe_customer->id;
    $conn->save();
    $
```

That works. And I can set `guarded=[]` to enter it directly... There's one remaining issue, though: relationships don't auto-recalculate, so I have to reload the staff object before I can use it... That's ugly, but it works.

```php
    $staff = Staff::find(1);
    $staff->stripe_customer;
    $staff->stripe_customer = Null;
    $cust = StripeCustomer::find('cus_5u0FTqMMS43tAb');
    $staff->stripe_customer = $cust;
    $conn = new StripeConnection(['staff_id'=>$staff->id, 'stripe_customer'=>$cust->id]);
    $staff = $staff->find($staff->id);
```
