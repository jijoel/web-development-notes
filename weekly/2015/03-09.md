======================
I'm starting to think about scenario-based testing. It seems to me that a lot of the acceptance tests that I want to do are based on a variety of scenarios. We'll have a customer who has a set of reservations, payments, spa appointments, van runs, and purchases. A good test could take all of that into account. 

Even better would be the ability to take edge cases directly from the database, load them in as scenarios, and make sure they run, too.

How can we make something like that?
