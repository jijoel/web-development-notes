===================
I'm running into a question with paginators. I have a couple of fields in my table, first_name and last_name. My model includes a "name" attribute that combines these. I would like to return paginated results with id and name as text. How can I do that?

I don't think I can go through my actual model. I think I have to just use a (pseudo) name instead. It's not very complex, so I can just use:

    return $this->guests->where('guest_visit_id', Input::get('id'))
        ->paginate(10, [
            "guest_visit_id as id", 
            DB::raw("concat(first_name,' ',last_name) as text")]
        );

It's a lot uglier than what I'd like to do, though. Ideally, I'd love to just run the results through a presenter...

Next issue: I have three models:

StripeRefund: id, charge_id
StripeCharge: id
StripeConnection: id, stripe_id

I would really like to be able to get the connection information from the refund.
