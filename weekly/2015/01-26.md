=========================
I just ran in to something interesting. I'm attempting to load data from an online database. The accout that I'm trying to do it with has limited permissions. My code looks like this:

```php
    private function loadTransferFileDataToLocalDatabase()
    {
	    DB::unprepared(file_get_contents(
	        $this->getConfig('local-file-name')
	    ));
	}
```

The SQL code includes this line:

```sql
	LOCK TABLES `transfer` WRITE;
```

My user account does NOT have LOCK TABLES permission (which is very simple to add). When I run the above function, I get nothing -- it just fails, silently. When I run it in a console window, it shows that it's a permission error. When I run it in Laravel, I really want a notification that I don't have permission to do what I just asked to do.

If I enter `$a = DB::unprepared(file_get_contents(...));`, and look at $a, it returns 1 (eg, there is an error). I tried using this to see the error, but no dice:

```php
    var_dump(DB::getPdo()->errorInfo());
```

I also tried `DB::getPdo()->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);` to force it to throw an exception. Still no dice. It looks like that's the default, anyway (set in Illuminate\Database\Connectors\Connector).

Really not sure why I'm not getting an error, or how to make it work with a limited account...

I can change my mysql statement to avoid things that will throw an error...

Maybe I can revisit how to catch an error later.
