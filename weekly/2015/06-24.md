=======================
Thinking a little bit about keys... The key size for my stripe keys is massive (32 bytes). Would it be better to have a lookup table and use locally generated uniqid() values as the actual internal key? Those can be 8 bytes...
    
    CREATE TABLE `x_test` (`id` BINARY(8) NOT NULL, `stripe_id` varchar(32) ) COLLATE='utf8_unicode_ci' ENGINE=InnoDB;

In a php function, I can use a stripe ID like this:

    $stripe = 'ch_xxx';  (received from Stripe)
    $id = uniqid();

    $packed = pack('H*',$id);
    DB::table('x_test')->insert([
        'id' => $packed,
        'stripe_id' => $stripe,     // for actual lookup
        'stripe_id' => $id,         // to see it's putting in the actual uniqid value...
    ]);

This creates a little bit of complexity when querying for the actual Stripe values -- I'll need to look them up. In exchange, it uses much smaller keys (8 bytes, instead of 32).
