============================

I have a problem. Basically, I want to have several methods available via a trait. HistoryTrait would show the history of an object, via a History object.

HistoryTrait includes a created_at attribute. It is called like this:

```php
    public function getCreatedAtAttribute()
    {
        return $this->getHistoryAttribute()->created_at;
    }
```

The History object returns the creation date:

```php
    public function getCreatedAt()
    {
        return DateRange::make(
            $this->record->create_date ?: DateRange::none()
        );
    }
```

The problem occurs if I don't want `create_date` to be the name of the attribute. In old tables in the database, it is, but I want everything else to use `created_at` (which is standard in Laravel). And then I get an infinite loop between the trait the History class.

Maybe I should include the History class in my model, and access everything via $model->history->created_at, instead of just $model->created_at... I like the cleaner syntax of the latter, but the former won't hurt...
