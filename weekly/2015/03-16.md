=======================
I'm playing a little bit with using Eloquent outside of Laravel. To do this, I'm using Capsule, which is first included in Laravel 4.1.

It's fun to use. I can even run migrations and seeds. This is a bootstrap file for tests:

```php
    if (!is_file(dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php')) {
        throw new RuntimeException('Install dependencies to run test suite.');
    }

    require dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    Dotenv::load(__DIR__.'/../');

    use Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager as Capsule;
    use Illuminate\Events\Dispatcher;
    use Illuminate\Container\Container;
    use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\DatabaseMigrationRepository;
    use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migrator;
    use Illuminate\Filesystem\Filesystem;
    use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Builder as SchemaBuilder;

    // Get Eloquent ready to use 
    $capsule = new Capsule;

    $capsule->addConnection([
        'driver'    => 'sqlite',
        'database'  => ':memory:',
    ]);

    $capsule->setEventDispatcher(new Dispatcher(new Container));
    $capsule->bootEloquent();
    $capsule->setAsGlobal();

    // Run the migrations
    $resolver = $capsule->getDatabaseManager();
    $repo = new DatabaseMigrationRepository($resolver, 'migrations');
    $migrator = new Migrator($repo, $resolver, new Filesystem);
    $schema = new SchemaBuilder($capsule->getConnection());

    $repo->createRepository();
    $migrator->run(__DIR__.'/../src/database/migrations');

    // Run the seeds
    require dirname(__DIR__) . '/tests/fixtures.php';
    $seeder = new TestSeeder($capsule);
    $seeder->run();

    // Load the base TestCase class
    require dirname(__DIR__) . '/tests/TestCase.php';
```

This gives me Eloquent, Events, migrations, and seeds, and lets me start testing. The one thing that I haven't figured out how to do yet is to run DB::beginTransaction at the beginning of each test, and DB::rollback at the end. I can't pass in $capsule to the TestCase...

Ahhh... I can't do that in TestCase, but I can do it in individual model tests:

```php
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->test = new MyModel;
        $this->test->getConnection()->beginTransaction();
    }

    public function tearDown()
    {
        $this->test->getConnection()->rollBack();
    }
```
