=======================

I learned an interesting thing today:

    $test = App::make('Kalani\KDB\WebConnection\StripeCreator');

... will create an object with that name, but not run through the service provider

    $test = new Kalani\KDB\WebConnection\StripeCreator(
        App::make('local-stripe'), new StripeConnection
    );

... will correctly load things with the service provider.
