========================
I think I may have come up with a nice, consistent way to create urls for my restful controllers. I can send $urls to my views, and create them like so:

```php
    private function getUrls($id = null)
    {
        $class = get_class($this);

        return new DTO([
            'index' => URL::action("$class@index"),
            'create' => URL::action("$class@create"),
            'store' => URL::action("$class@store"),
        ]);
    }
```

It would probably be good to cache them...

In my form, I can use:

    {{ Form::open(array('url' => $urls->store, 'class'=>'form-inline')) }}

or:
    
    <form action="{{$urls->store}}" method="post" class="form-inline">
